LuaJIT Raw-Bytecode Decompiler (LJD)
===

A Rework based on [Dr-MTN/luajit-decompiler](https://github.com/Dr-MTN/luajit-decompiler)

__WARNING!__ This code is not finished or tested! There is not even
the slightest warranty that the resulting code is even close to the original.
Use the decompiled code at your own risk.

__SECOND WARNING!__ This is all a huge prototype. The "release" version
should be written in Lua itself, because it's cool to
decompile the decompiler â€” a great test too!


Requirements:
---

Python __3.7+__ from Python.org


How To Use:
---

Use helper functions in `tools.py`, e.g. `set_luajit_version`, `process_bytes`, `process_file`, `process_folder`.

Typical usage:
```python
from ljd.tools import set_luajit_version, process_file

# default version is 21, for LuaJIT-2.0.1
# set version to 20 for LuaJIT-2.0.0
set_luajit_version(20)

process_file('byte-code-path.lj', 'output-path.lua')
```


TODO:
---

1. Improve `eliminate_temporary` process.
	
	there are things like
	```lua
	for xxx do
		slot2 = 0 + xxx
	end
	```
	it should be
	```lua
	slot2 = 0
	for xxx do
		slot2 = slot2 + xxx
	end
	```

---
